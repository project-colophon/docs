# Introduction

### What is Colophon?

Colophon is a set of open source tools that enables teams to catalogue their software projects, and act as a single source of truth for all non-technical data!

### non-technical data?

Usually within large teams, hundreds of software repositories exist, where information get lost frequently.  
information such as:

* Ownership _\(Department, Teams, Individuals, ...\)_
* Schedules _\(Launch, Sunset, ...\)_
* Environments _\(Production & Staging, Databases, Reporting, ...\)_
* External References _\(Issue Tracking Board, Wikis, Cost Sheets, Roadmaps, ...\)_

### What are some of the use cases for using Colophon?

* Quickly scan through repositories for human readable and business information beyond code
* Create reports on project health and ownership
* Codify business & operational concerns that are typically undocumented
  * Timelines and scheduled operations around the project _\(e.g. sunset date\)_
  * external references to the project _\(e.g. kanban board, budget\)_
* Use in CI/CD tooling to annotate your artefacts / notify owners
* Correlation of application instances and source code through exposing the project's `id` value in HTTP Headers / HTML Meta
